            <h3>My Motto:</h3>
            <p>''Everybody can sell products and services, but not all give <em><strong>Experience</strong></em> while doing so''</p>
            <p>Currently I am studying at the University of Surrey at MSc Digital Marketing and Channel Management and by September 2022 I will be graduating. I am looking forward to becoming a vital asset to a big company where I can deliver experiences to customers and memories which will relate to the company's value.</p>
